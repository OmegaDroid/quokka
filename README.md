quokka
======

The happy little release animal.

This is a system for controlling releases. It allows for any member of the team to propose a release but requires a set of authorisers to allow for a release to be set free. Non team members have access to the latest authorised builds which can be tagged for specific purposes such as for specific customers or testing.

Requirements
============

Quokka requires Django 1.7+, this cn be obtained here 'https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.7b2/tarball/'.
